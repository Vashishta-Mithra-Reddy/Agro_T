# Agro_T
This GitHub repo contains an IoT model for agriculture that detects animals, controls soil moisture, and uploads data to Thingspeak. It also has an IFTTT applet for message alerts. The model is built with Python and requires a Node MCU, IoT sensors, Thingspeak API key, and IFTTT account. Contributions are welcome.
